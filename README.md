#  BWATCH
The BWATCH project is developed to study motivation, engagement and emotional states during binge watching.

In this Android application, I am extracting the Heart Rate (PPG), Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor data from an Android Wear compatible device. The data is then stored in a marshalled csv file along with the timestamp. The marshalling is done in the following format:
      
      date, time, hr, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z, acc_x,  acc_y,  acc_z
