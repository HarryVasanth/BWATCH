# ⌚️ BWATCH

The BWATCH project is developed to study motivation, engagement and emotional states during binge-watching.

In this Android application, I am extracting the Heart Rate (PPG), Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor data from an Android Wear-compatible device. The data is then stored in a marshalled csv file along with the timestamp. The marshalling is done in the following format:

```csv
 date, time, hr, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z, acc_x,  acc_y,  acc_z
```

### Abstract

The popularity of internet-distributed TV entertainment services, such as Netflix, has transformed TV consumption behavior. Currently, the level of control viewers have over their TV experiences, along with the release of complete seasons at once, are some of the factors that stimulate the so-called binge-watching phenomenon (the consumption of several episodes of a program in a single sitting). Most of binge-watching studies have focused on viewers’ habits and health effects. This paper presents a study that relates to viewers’ behaviors and moods. It was carried out with 13 young participants at their home, watching online content, collecting physiological, inertial, and self-reported data. We identify and compare binge-watching with non-binge-watching behaviors. Our results suggest that while viewers recur to online serial entertainment in pursuit of leisure related needs, such as relaxation, relief from boredom and escapism, the act of binge-watching tends to make them feel rather unsatisfied with no change in Arousal. Nevertheless, in binge-watching the Positive Affect increases while the Negative decreases. Moreover, watching a single episode only, tends to result in increased arousal and but not necessarily in increased satisfaction. This preliminary finding can be the starting point of fruitful future investigations on unpacking further motives and nuances from this outcome.
